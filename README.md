# Hotel_Booking_Project
A project where we use SQL Server and Tableau and analytical skills to solve a problem for a hotel and resort company.
We build the database and clean the data, make some neseccary calculations using SQL. Then use tableau for some visualization and dashboarding.
The few questions we answer:
  * How are the revenues growing with year segement-wise and country-wise
  * How do the trends look for the business over past 3 years
  * Do we require more parking space
